Hello people of earth- my name is Josh Adler and this is my first repository. I am a devoted outdoorsman and aspiring experience designer, carrying intentions of merging the adventure of camping with useful digital fronts and intelligent product design. 


I am a very lactose intolerant being. This means that my body rejects dairy products- but I CAN take a pill to induce enzymes in my stomach module that will digest lactose. One day, I hope that I can take a pill to bring me out of the matrix of lactose intolerance.
